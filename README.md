## Project Summary

This app is a 'reddit' style application for board game reviews. The user can view a list of the reviews (with various sorting options), read a single review and also comment and 'like/upvote' a review.

## How to Use the App

The link above will direct you to the homepage. The homepage contains a list of all the reviews available to read. To browse by category, use the navigation bar and select the category you wish to view. If you want to return to the full list on the homepage, simply click the home icon.

There is also the option to order and sort the reviews. You can choose to sort the reviews by the date written, the amount of votes the review (vote count) has and the amount of comments the review has (comment count). These can be viewed in ascending or descending order.

To read a review, click on one of the review cards in the list. You can increase or decrease the number of votes by 1 using the voting buttons. You can also view the comments on a review by clicking the "view" button next to the comment count.

To add a new comment, type your comment into the input box and press post. You are unable to post blank comments.

To delete a comment that you have previously made, you can click on the delete button.

There is also a back button on each review if you wish to return to the previous page.
